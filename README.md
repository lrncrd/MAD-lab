MAD-Lab | Modelling Archaeological Data. Laboratory for Behavioural and Computational Archaeology of the Ancient Mediterranean
https://www.ispc.cnr.it/it_it/2021/05/28/mad-lab/

The purpose of the MAD-Lab is to investigate and understand the behaviour of archaeologically-explored societies in the Mediterranean Basin, with a particular focus on the Central Mediterranean in Later Prehistory (6th â€“ 1st mill. BC).
The MAD-Lab was established on a cooperation linking the CNR ISPC and the Laboratory of Agent-Based Social Simulation (LABSS) within the CNR - Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (CNR ISTC).
